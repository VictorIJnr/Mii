# This is Mii

What are the chances I get sued by Nintendo? Actually, I'd like to see them try. Just to clarify, this isn't affiliated with Nintendo. No. This is **_MUCH_** better than anything they could come up with. This right here is revolutionary. It's innovative. It's creative. It's blockchain. It's machine learning. It's big data. It's an A12 Bionic Chip. And since I've already run out of buzzwords, it's also my personal website.

## Viewing the Website
I shouldn't really need to tell you how to get to the website. Like. I've linked it in my bio for one. And it's a website. So, yeah... Anyway, there's 2 parts to this repo: [preReact](preReact/) and [mii](mii/). If you go to the deployed [website](https://victorijnr.com), you'll see the Mii build. There's no way for you to view the preReact verison unless you decide to clone the repo and view the [index page](preReact/index.html) offline. Wait. I was wrong. For a limited time only you can see the preReact version on my [host website](https://vi4.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/)! But hurry! This offer is set to expire when I leave St Andrews! Or when I decide I don't want it anymore! Either way, I'd advise against it, unless you absolutely adore playing around with particles.js for some reason. In the future I may move the preReact version to a subdomain like [old.victorijnr.com](old.victorijnr.com) as a homage to when I couldn't make a nice website. It'll be just like [new Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [old Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/).

## Version Differences
As you could probably guess, preReact is a version of my website I made, which doesn't utilise React whatsoever. No, that's just barebones HTML, CSS and JS. I give it a 7.8/10, not buzz-wordy enough. **WAIT**. It does have bootstrap though. Oh, and jQuery.  
The Mii version though. That, that's clean. What else can I say. It's the pinnacle of website design. The Mona Lisa of websites if you will. It truly is a supermodel of unprecedented beauty.<sup><sup>As long as you don't visit it on mobile, I need to work on that.</sup></sup> You know what? Just take a look for yourself. [Go on.](https://victorijnr.com) They won't bite.
