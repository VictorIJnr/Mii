        <p>Contextual triggering and speech recognition for Artificially Intelligent Assistants, I hope... That's kinda optimistic... </p>

        <p>If you play around with the letters in "Contextual" (as in Contextual Triggering) you get Cutex.</p>

        <h2 id="cutexisadumbname">Cutex is a dumb name</h2>

        <p>Well GitHub recommended the name "<em>fantastic-octo-barnacle</em>". Is that better? No. This is Cutex. Since I decided to be special, this is pronounced like LaTeX, but Cutex. Not "Cu-te&#65279;<strong><em>KS</em></strong>". Cutex. Got it? Good.</p>

        <h2 id="waitwhatsthis">Wait, what's this?</h2>

        <p><strong>I. JUST. TOLD. YOU.</strong> <em>Fine</em>... Cutex <strong>may <em>or may not</em></strong> be serving as the basis for my SH project (if it does, this will quickly become private, sorry). Cutex is a means of triggering artificially intelligent assistants, such as Google Assistant (let's ignore <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex</a> for now, it sucks anyway), Alexa, Bixby and Cortana (look who's not invited to the party) via the context of the situation, as opposed to annoying triggers.</p>

        <h2 id="aightthenbutwhy">Aight then, but why?</h2>

        <p>Don't be like this... But no one says "Okay Google who was the 44<sup>th</sup> president of the United States?" (Barack Obama) or "Hey Bixby when is my next meeting?" (I don't know, check your calendar), naturally. People are stupid. We always wait until we know that Google or Bixby have been triggered before asking our question. <strong>Hopefully</strong>, Cutex will allow people to just go "I forgot when my meeting is." and then respond with "Don't worry you still have 45 minutes before your 2pm meeting with Cynthia." </p>

        <h2 id="soundsgucci">Sounds Gucci</h2>

        <p>Indeed, however the act of actually implementing Cutex will be far from "Gucci". I'll most likely need an insane <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</a> (pretend you didn't see that tutorial part) to ensure that I'll be able to actually recognise natural language. It doesn't really impact anything regarding this as I expected to need an incredible RNN to actually process context in terms of speech in the first place. </p>

        <h2 id="damnsonsoundslikesometonyjarviskindashiz">Damn son, sounds like some Tony Jarvis kinda shiz</h2>

        <p><strong><em>WHO IS "TONY JARVIS"?!?!?!!!?!??!?</em></strong> You know what. Yes it's some <strong><em>Tony Jarvis typa shiz</em></strong>. Cutex, obviously, will only allow for contextual triggering and recognition of input, <a href="https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-natural-language-processing-nlp/">Natural Language Processing</a> is it's own minefield that Cutex won't worry about. I'll leave that to something like <a href="https://wit.ai/">Wit</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="whatsnextfam">What's next fam?</h2>

        <p><em>Fam</em>? **<strong>sigh</strong>**, I'll probably be learning <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> to implement Cutex (nearly typed the name of a secret project I'm working on there), which isn't my ideal choice since I <strong><em>really</em></strong> want to program more in C++. But whatever, Python it is. And yeah, I don't know what more there is for me to say at this point.</p>

        <h2 id="howboutbye">How 'bout "bye"?</h2>

        <p>Okay that. <em>Bye.</em></p>
