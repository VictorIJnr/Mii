                    These are a few personal projects that I've done over the years. Primarily, you'll see projects I completed during my education.<br />
                    But you <i>may</i> see a hackathon project which is in no way an expression of my views.<br /><br />

                        That should be enough of a warning, but don't worry, it's mostly vanilla work.

                My current job as a software development engineer in test.<br /><br />
                My focus has been automating our manual test cases in C# using SpecFlow - .NET's implementation of Cucumber.<br />
                {/* However, that doesn't stop me from dabbling as a scrum master, with manual QA, and aiding our developers whenever necessary. */}

               My undergraduate dissertation. A rather straightforward clustering experiment, based on a writer's stylometry.<br /><br />
               {/* I was ambitious to begin with; I wanted to do some stylometry-influenced natural language generation, but I didn't have enough time.<br /><br /> */}
               In short, I have a SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network that are all able to differentiate between Drake and William Shakespeare.

                The first Android app I've ever made.<br /><br />
                Flappy Bird was "problematic" a year prior to me making this, so I thought making another endless runner would be fun.

                A website I made for the St Andrews Waffle Company.<br /><br />
                I took this as a chance to test out my skills, and play around with Bootstrap. Oh, and get paid an eye-watering Â£0.
                {/* In my defence, they didn't use it. I didn't even contact them about it for that matter... Anyway, I had fun, and learnt a lot making it. That matters more than getting paid for it. Right? */}
                {/* Other than my first iteration of my personal website (I'm doing you a favour by burying that deep in the repo history), this was the first website I made. */}
                {/* I loved this at the time, especially the diagonal menus; who thinks of that?. */}
                {/* However, I've learned to get over my stubborness towards aspects like responsive design, which I ignored in this project, in order to improve myself. */}
                {/* It was also a great chance to use Bootstrap, especially it's grids and carousels, even though I'm not using Bootstrap in this iteration of my personal webiste. */}
                {/* For your sake, I hope you're not looking at the Waffle Co website on mobile. */}
