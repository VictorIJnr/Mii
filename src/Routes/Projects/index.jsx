            <p>
                These are a few personal projects that I've done over the years. Primarily, you'll see projects I completed during my education.<br />
                I'm constantly playing around with anything I find interesting, and this is just a snapshot of the work I'm comfortable sharing for now.<br /><br />
                After all, I can't exactly have you Zuckerberging my unicorns, can I?<br />

                    <b>My current job as a software development engineer in test.</b><br /><br />
                    My focus has been automating our manual test cases in C# using SpecFlow - .NET's implementation of Cucumber.<br />
                    {/* However, that doesn't stop me from dabbling as a scrum master, with manual QA, and aiding our developers whenever necessary. */}

                <p>
                <b>My undergraduate dissertation: a clustering experiment, based on a writer's stylometry.</b><br /><br />
                {/* I was ambitious to begin with; I wanted to do some stylometry-influenced natural language generation, but I didn't have enough time.<br /><br /> */}
                In short, I have a SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network that are all able to differentiate between Drake and William Shakespeare.

                    <b>The first Android app I ever made.</b><br /><br />
                    Flappy Bird was "problematic" a year prior to me making this, so I thought making another endless runner would be fun.

                    <b>A website I made for the St Andrews Waffle Company.</b><br /><br />
                    I took this as a chance to test out my skills, and play around with Bootstrap. Oh, and get paid an eye-watering Â£0.
