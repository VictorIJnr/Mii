            <p>
                These are a few personal projects that I've done over the years.
                <br />
                I'm constantly playing around with anything I find interesting, and I've recently began learning Kotlin so I can do make something cool using NFC.
                <br /><br />
                But, some projects in progress will remain private, for now. I don't want to accidentally Zuckerberg myself.<br />

                <p>
                    <b>My undergraduate dissertation: a clustering experiment, based on a writer's stylometry.</b><br /><br />
                    In short, I have a SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network that are all able to differentiate between Drake and William Shakespeare.

            <Highlight title="Bloopy" image={bloopy} projectPath="bloopy" reversed={true}>
                <p>
                    <b>The first Android app I ever made.</b><br /><br />
                    Flappy Bird was "problematic" a year prior to me making this, so I thought making another endless runner would be fun.

            <Highlight title="Waffle Co" image={waffles} projectPath="waffles">
                <p>
                    <b>A website I made for the St Andrews Waffle Company.</b><br /><br />
                    I took this as a chance to test out my skills, and play around with Bootstrap. Oh, and get paid an eye-watering Â£0.
